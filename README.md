# Fake-News-Prediction
Our project investigates the spread of fake news on social media and aims to identify user-related metrics that can differentiate between users who are likely to spread fake news and those who are not. We will use graph analysis techniques and the NetworkX package in Python to achieve this goal. The study of fake news spread on social media is complex and interdisciplinary, requiring knowledge from multiple fields, including computer science, sociology, and psychology.
Our project will explore the role of user-related metrics, such as network centrality, in the spread of fake news on social media networks. By conducting a thorough analysis of social media networks, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to the spread of fake news. This information will be valuable in developing strategies for detecting and preventing the spread of fake news. Our findings will shape future efforts to mitigate the dangers posed by fake news and promote responsible information sharing practices.
